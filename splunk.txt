which event mpst popular

| stats count by Event


lets see failed login attemps

index=cctv_feed *failed*


	NOTICE: all the login failed have happened at the same time so suspicious and also have the same session_id
	hmmmm we can use session_id to find the malicious user


index = cctv_feed *session_id*
now change our idex to web_logs

we'll find client ip 

same ip address but different session id
