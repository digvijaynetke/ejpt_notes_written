# Post-exploitation

```
Post-exploitation is the final phase of the penetration testing process and consists of the tactics,
techniques, and procedures that attackers/adversaries undertake after obtaining initial access to a
target system. In this course, you will learn about how to perform local enumeration on target systems
 to identify critical information like users and groups, credentials, and services. You will also
learn how to elevate your privileges on Windows and Linux targets, as well as how to maintain access
to target systems after compromise. You will also learn how to dump and crack hashes for legitimate
authentication or lateral movement. Furthermore, you will also learn how to perform internal network
discovery and how to pivot to systems you have discovered on the targetâ€™s internal network.

The objective of this course is to give you in-depth hands-on skills necessary to perform all the
 tasks that make up the post-exploitation phase of the penetration testing lifecycle.
