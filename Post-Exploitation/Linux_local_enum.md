# üêß Linux Local Enumeration

## üîç Enumerating System Information

### üéØ Objective

To gather essential system details such as the Linux distribution, version, kernel architecture, CPU, disk info, mount points, and installed packages ‚Äî all crucial for **privilege escalation** and **post-exploitation analysis**.

---

### üß© What We Look For

* Hostname
* Distribution name and version
* Kernel architecture and build
* CPU information
* Disk and mounted drives
* Installed software and packages
* System environment variables

---

### üíª Commands & Explanation

After obtaining a shell or upgrading to a Meterpreter session:

```bash
sysinfo               # Get quick system overview (in Meterpreter)
shell
/bin/bash -i          # Get interactive bash shell
cd /root
```

#### üñ•Ô∏è Basic System Info

```bash
hostname              # System name
cat /etc/issue        # Short distribution info
cat /etc/*release     # Detailed distro info (ID, VERSION, PRETTY_NAME, etc.)
uname -a              # Kernel version, build info, and architecture
```

#### üå± Environment & Hardware

```bash
env                   # View environment variables (PATH, USER, SHELL, etc.)
lscpu                 # CPU architecture, model, and thread info
free -h               # Memory usage (RAM and swap)
```

#### üíæ Disk and Mount Info

```bash
df -h                 # Disk usage for all partitions
df -ht ext4           # Limit output to ext4 file systems
lsblk | grep sd       # List block devices (e.g., /dev/sda ‚Äî like C: drive in Windows)
```

> üí° **Note:** `/dev/sda` is the main storage device ‚Äî similar to **C:** in Windows.

#### üì¶ Installed Packages

```bash
dpkg -l               # For Debian-based systems
rpm -qa               # For RedHat/CentOS systems
pacman -Q             # For Arch-based systems
```

Every utility or software is considered a **package** in Linux ‚Äî making package enumeration key for finding vulnerable versions.

---

## üë§ Enumerating Users and Groups

### üß† What to Look For

* Current user and privileges
* Other users on the system
* Groups and memberships

---

### üíª Commands

```bash
getuid                # Meterpreter: show current user
shell
/bin/bash -i
whoami                # Show current user
groups bob            # Show all groups for user 'bob'
groups root           # Groups for root user
```

#### üßæ Listing All Users

```bash
cat /etc/passwd       # Displays all user and service accounts
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v /nologin  # Show only real (login-capable) users
ls /home              # List home directories (typically one per real user)
```

* `/etc/passwd` ‚Äî contains user information
* `/etc/shadow` ‚Äî contains password hashes (root-only access)

#### üë• Managing Users (demo)

```bash
useradd bob -s /bin/bash                 # Add user with bash shell
useradd -m john -s /bin/bash             # Add user + home directory
groups                                   # Display current groups
usermod -aG root bob                     # Add bob to root group (privilege escalation)
```

#### üßç Viewing Logged-in Users

```bash
w                                        # Who‚Äôs logged in and what they‚Äôre doing
who                                      # Simpler view
last                                     # Show login history
lastlog                                  # Display last login for all accounts
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Difference between Root, Administrator, and NT Authority:**
> In Linux, the **root** user = full system control.
> Windows uses **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** for the same role, while **Administrators** is a group containing privileged users.

## üåê Enumerating Network Information

### üéØ What to Identify

* Current IP and adapters
* Internal network info
* TCP/UDP services
* Other hosts on the network
* Routing and ARP tables

---

### üíª Commands

#### From Meterpreter:

```bash
ifconfig             # Display network interfaces and IPs
netstat              # List active connections
route                # Show routing table
arp                  # Show ARP table
```

#### From Shell:

```bash
ifconfig / ip a s           # Network configuration
cat /etc/networks           # Network configuration file
cat /etc/hostname           # Hostname
cat /etc/hosts              # Local host-to-IP mappings
cat /etc/resolv.conf        # DNS info
arp -a                      # ARP table with active connections
```

> üß≠ **Tip:** Understanding subnet masks and routes helps you map internal networks ‚Äî essential for **pivoting**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Enumerating Processes and Cron Jobs

### üß† Objective

To identify **running services and processes**, and enumerate **cron jobs** ‚Äî which are the Linux equivalent of **Windows scheduled tasks**.
Poorly configured cron jobs are a **common privilege escalation vector**.

---

### üíª Process Enumeration

#### From Meterpreter:

```bash
ps                      # List all processes (PID, PPID, Name, Arch, User, Path, TTY, Time, CMD)
pgrep vsftpd            # Find process by name
pkill vsftpd            # Kill process
kill <PID>              # Kill process by PID
```

> üß© **Explanation of `ps` fields:**
>
> * **PID:** Process ID
> * **PPID:** Parent Process ID
> * **NAME:** Executable name
> * **ARCH:** Architecture (x86/x64)
> * **USER:** Owner of process
> * **PATH:** Location of binary
> * **TTY:** Terminal attached
> * **TIME:** CPU time consumed
> * **CMD:** Command used to start the process

#### From Shell:

```bash
/bin/bash -i
ps aux                        # List all processes
ps aux | grep "process_name"  # Filter by process
ps aux | grep root            # Show root-owned processes
top                           # Real-time resource usage
```

---

### ‚è∞ Cron Job Enumeration

```bash
crontab -l                    # List cron jobs for current user
ls -al /etc/cron*             # List cron directories and files
cat /etc/cron*                # Display contents of cron job files
```

> üí° **Tip:** Look for scripts running as **root** or using **wildcards**, or writable files/scripts ‚Äî ideal for privilege escalation.

---

## ü§ñ Automating Linux Local Enumeration

To save time and discover privilege escalation paths quickly, use **automated enumeration scripts** and **Metasploit post modules**.

---

### üß∞ Useful Metasploit Modules

```bash
search enum_configs           # Enumerates configuration files
search enum_network           # Gathers network data (routes, DNS, interfaces)
search enum_system            # Gathers system info, cron jobs, binaries, etc.
search checkvm                # Detect if system is a VM
```

---

### üßæ LinEnum Script

> üì¶ **Repository:** [github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum)

#### üìã Steps

```bash
cd /tmp                       # Work in temporary directory
upload /root/Desktop/LinEnum.sh
chmod +x LinEnum.sh            # Grant execute permissions
./LinEnum.sh                   # Run the script
```

#### üß† LinEnum Features

* System kernel, version, hostname
* Users and group memberships
* `/etc/passwd` info
* Permissions on `/home`
* Environment variables
* Available shells and umask values
* Password and shadow file checks
* Cron jobs and running services
* Network info (ARP, routes, interfaces)
* CPU, binaries, and SUID/SGID files
* Configuration files (e.g., sysctl.conf)
* Logs, mail, Docker containers, GCC, sudo version
* Detects misconfigurations for privilege escalation

> ‚ö° **Pro Tip:** Avoid uploading to `/tmp` on monitored systems; it‚Äôs often checked by blue teams.

Would you like me to add a **visual diagram (ASCII/markdown or image)** that shows the Linux enumeration flow (System ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Processes ‚Üí Cron ‚Üí Automation)?
It looks really clean on GitHub and makes your repo more professional.
