OWASP TOP 10 2021

broken access controlll
		insecure direct object reference...
		http request madhe id kivha parameters change karaayche anni user change hota a ki nahi baghaycha

CRYPTOGRAPHIC FAILURER
	gaining the admin access through watching the code carefully so the get more information on the server and then  trying to get *.db* file after getting sqllite3 access it then try to db info ....then if hashing is weak then you'll get the password bby hashing from sha 256 decoder or MD5


INJECTION 
	sql injection
		 This occurs when user-controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. This could potentially allow the attacker to access, modify and delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries. This would mean an attacker could steal sensitive information such as personal details and credentials.
	command injection:
		This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on application servers, potentially allowing them to access users' systems
		we should know the code and working of the code to execute the injection
	Exploiting Command Injection:
		echo "my username is $(whoami)"
			$ madhlla adhi execute hoil
		this willwork mostly 
		echo "kahi pan type karaych nantr $(command)"


INSECURE DESIGN
		TRY GUESSING PASSWORD OR RESETING THE PASWD BY EXPLOTING THE 
    AUTHENTICATION times

SECURITY MISCONFIGURATION
	Poorly configured permissions on cloud services, like S3 buckets.
	Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges.(open ftp)
	Default accounts with unchanged passwords.(admin - admin)
	Error messages that are overly detailed and allow attackers to find out more about the system.(assests or upload location in code comment)
	Not using HTTP security headers.(https not enable)

	debugging interfaces(python console open or enabled)

	
VUNERABLE AND OUTDATED COMPONENTS
	zero day establisher exploits or exploits on the exploit.db

INDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
	username as "admin"   then create new register as " admin" with space..it will have same power or same acc login but different pass
