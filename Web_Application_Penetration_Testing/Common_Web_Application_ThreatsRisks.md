# Common Web Application Threats & Risks

Web applications are everywhere — banking, shopping, social media, government portals.
Because they are **public-facing** and handle **valuable data**, they are constantly targeted by attackers.

Understanding these threats helps developers, security teams, and organizations build **strong, proactive defenses**.

* Threats vary in impact depending on the app’s:

  * design
  * vulnerabilities
  * security measures
* Web app security must always be **proactive**, **continuous**, and **comprehensive**.

# ⚔️ **Threat vs Risk**

## 🔥 **Threat**

A *threat* is **anything that can potentially cause harm** by exploiting a vulnerability.

### Examples:

* Hackers
* Malware
* Phishing
* Ransomware
* DoS attacks
* Malicious insiders
* Natural disasters (floods, power failures)

👉 **Threat = Potential harm.
Not guaranteed, but possible.**

---

## ⚠️ **Risk**

A *risk* is the **chance (likelihood)** that a threat will actually exploit a vulnerability **AND** how bad the impact will be.

### Risk depends on:

* **Likelihood** (How likely is the attack?)
* **Impact** (How damaging will it be?)

👉 **Risk = Probability + Impact of the threat happening.**

---

# 🧠 **Threat vs Risk — Summary**

* **Threat = What can go wrong**
* **Risk = How likely + how bad it will be**

Even if threats exist, the **risk can be low** when strong security controls are in place.
